# Project 1 - Pomodoro Timer
This timer will help people trying to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
It will vibrate to tell you when to take breaks or resume working, based on some determined values. 

## Requirements
- Timer should display minutes and seconds in text
- Timer should count down seconds until it reaches 00:00
- Phone should buzz when timer reaches 0
- Timers should switch between 25 and 5 minutes
- Timer should be able to start, stop, and reset

### Challenge
- Allow the user to input any arbitrary time for the timers (e.g. 5 mins of work time and 5 mins of break)
